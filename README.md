# Hi there 👋

<p>My name is Jaleel. Born and raised near Ural mountains, then lived in Moscow where I've recieved degree in Moscow State Technical University. Before moving to Munich, I've worked as mobile software developer in several companies and made apps from scratch for different bussines purposes.
</p>
<p>Last 5 years I'm working with Apple platforms, frameworks (like HealthKit and CoreML) and using Swift language both for frontend and backend needs. Recently moved to Munich to enjoy Bavarian landscapes and way of life. 🏔🚵🍻🥨⚽️
</p>

<p>A bit more thoughts:
</p>
- 🔭 I’m currently working on the [Holidu](https://www.holidu.de) app — a search engine for vacation rentals, based in Munich.
- Swift is the preferred language for me at the moment.
- Trying to experiment with old and new stuff in the computer world, like writing a game engine, Swift backend, or replicating SwiftUI by wrapping UIStackView into a declarative layout system [KDUI](https://github.com/akbashev/KindaDeclarativeUI).
- Making some photos from time to time, even being chosen to be printed in the Unsplash book. More info—[Usplash](https://unsplash.com/@jaleel_akbash)
- Love football. Dream to own my football club one day. 😅 Mostly for experiments and ideas arround football, tactics and players perfomance.
